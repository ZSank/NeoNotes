1. Branching Strategy
   1. NO direct code changes must be done on Master. 
   2. Only the code merges from develop will be done on master. 
   3. Feature branches can be created from develop branch. And after feature completion, it that feature branch needs to be merged into develop. And eventually, develop will be merged into master. 
   4. Master branch is used as in, it contains production level code. So, no beta changes will be present in the master.
