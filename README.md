# TetraNotes
Notes android app
1. TetraNotes Android app allows users to create, edit, and organize their notes in a user-friendly way. 
2. The app was built using Kotlin programming language and MVVM architecture to ensure code maintainability and scalability. 
3. I used Hilt to simplify dependency injection and Room database to enable efficient and secure data storage. 
4. The app also uses LiveData and Data Binding to update the user interface in real-time.

The app has several features, including:

1. Note Creation: Users can create notes with a title, description, and optional category, using a simple and intuitive interface.
2. Note Organization: Users can organize their notes by category and view them in a list or grid layout for easy access.
3. Note Editing: Users can edit their notes anytime by tapping on the note they want to edit.
4. Note Deletion: Users can delete notes they no longer need.
5. Dark Mode: The app also features a dark mode option for users who prefer a darker color scheme.
